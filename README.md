# HotelBookingWebAPI
To give a chance to everyone to book the room, the stay can’t be longer than 3 days and can’t be reserved more than 30 days in advance. 
All reservations start at least the next day of booking.
To simplify the use case, a “DAY’ in the hotel room starts from 00:00 to 23:59:59.
Every end-user can check the room availability, place a reservation, cancel it or modify it.
